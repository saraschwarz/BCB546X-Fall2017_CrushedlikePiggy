  * Outline of selected paper and analysis conducted
  
## Code 
  * README - summarizes contents of folder
  * Data inspection code
    * Data_Inspection
  * Genotype_Table - The number of putative introgressed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), observed heterozygosity (Ho) based on 26505 SNPs with MAF>0.05 and mtDNA haplotype per individual hybrid wild boar.
  * PCA_Analysis - Principal component analysis (PCA) plot based on 26505 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with MAF>0.05. One shows grouping of 4 wild boar populations interposed with 9 introgressed indviduals. The second PCA includes a sample of all six domestic pig breeds.
  * SNP_Positions - Chromosome positions of introgressed SNPs across 4 different levels of hybridization.
