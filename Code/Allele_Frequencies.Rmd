# Description of file formats

```{}
The prefered file formats to work in Plink are text files with endings .ped (and .map), and the smaller binary PLINK files with endings .bed (+ .bim + .fam).

In PLINK, the input data file is split in 2 (or 3) files, each containing solely information on either genotypes and sample information (.ped), only genotypes (.bed), variant positions and information (.map / .bim), or sample information (.fam).
```
#1. Ped file

```{}
The .ped file contains the variant information with one allele per column (meaning 2 columns are needed for the two alleles of one variant). It has one line per sample with the first six columns being:
1 Family ID
2 Within-family ID (‘IID’; cannot be ‘0’)
3 Within-family ID of father (‘0’ if missing)
4 Within-family ID of mother (‘0’ if missing)
5 Sex code (‘1’ = male, ‘2’ = female, ‘0’ = unknown)
6 Phenotype value (‘1’ = control, ‘2’ = case, ‘-9’/’0’/non-numeric = missing data)

7-n The seventh and eighth columns are the alleles for the first variant, the second variant, etc. Missing data is coded as 0 (or -9).
```
#2 .map_file

```{}
The .map file contains the variant positions. It has 4 columns:
1 Chromosome code. PLINK 1.9 also permits contig or scaffold names here, but most older versions do not.
2 Variant identifier
3 Position in morgans or centimorgans (optional; ‘0’ = unknown)
4 Chromosome position in bp
```
# Quick data inspection to know the file sizes and snp info.
# 1. Length

$ wc -l DG_Boar.ped DG_Boar.map DG_Pig.ped DG_Pig.map

45720 DG_Boar.map
120 DG_Pig.ped
45720 DG_Pig.map
The data was correctly read into plink and corresponded to the 88 Boar and 120 Pig breeds that were genotypes. In both, 45720 autosomal snps were analyzed.

# Data formating to remove rare alleles that were poorly genotyped, Filtering based on MAF. This was done using the plink manual on hpc class.

```{}
Filtering on MAF can be done for multiple reasons but for this paper was to remove noise in samples sequenced with low coverage.
```
# 1. Filtering to get highly abundant rare SNPs using  0.005 < MAF <0.030 threshold. This returned compressed .map, .ped and .fam files which are easy to work with

```{}
$ plink --ped DG_Boar.ped --map DG_Boar.map --recode --maf 0.005 --max-maf 0.03 --out Boar_filtered.0.005
$ wc -l Boar_filtered.0.005.log Boar_filtered.0.005.map Boar_filtered.0.005.ped
 9287 Boar_filtered.0.005.map
 88 Boar_filtered.0.005.ped
#Note; The paper found 7083 highly abundant rare SNPs in the wild boardata set where as we found 9287 which was 2204 more.
````
#2. After allele frequency spectrum assessment, they excluded nonpolymorphic sites and potential genotyp-ing errors by applying a rigorous MAF threshold of 0.05 using PLINK, as a standard procedure. This left 26505 segregating autosomal SNPs although we found a different result ~2000 SNPs more

```{}
$ plink --ped DG_Boar.ped --map DG_Boar.map --maf 0.05 --recode --out Boar_filter
45720 variants loaded from .bim file.
88 people (0 males, 0 females, 88 ambiguous) loaded from .fam.
Ambiguous sex IDs written to plink.nosex .
Total genotyping rate is 0.986513.
17660 variants removed due to minor allele threshold(s)
28060 variants and 88 people pass filters and QC.

# Reading the data in R using the snpstats package of bioconducter which reads .ped and .map files and merge them together.

```{r}
#The plink data can be read in R usind the  read.pedfile, from snpStats. The information of the .ped file can be thought of as a combination of the .bed and .fam files. The .map file contains the first four columns of the .bim file, without the allele assignments.

#snpStats provides functions, col.summary and row.summary, that return statistics on SNPs and samples, respectively. For example, to calculate summary statistics for each SNP (column): I employed the col.summary function of snpstats as below
New_Boar_snp_summary <- col.summary(New_Boar.genotypes)
write.table(New_Boar_snp_summary, "/Users/ensamba/Group_project_emma/CrushedlikePiggy/New_Boar_snp_summary.txt", sep="\t", col.names=T, row.names=F)
#The col.summary returns a data frame with rows corresponding to columns of the input object and with columns/elements
```
Calls: The number of valid calls
Call.rate: The proportion of genotypes called
Certain.calls: Proportion of called SNPs with certain calls
RAF: The "risk" allele (allele B) frequency
MAF: The minor allele frequency
P.AA: The frequency of homozygous genotype 1 (A/A)
P.AB: The frequency of heterozygous genotype 2 (A/B)
P.BB: The frequency of homozygous genotype 3 (B/B)
z.HWE: A z-test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
```{}
I was most interested in the MAF, so I subset it out for downstream analysis to calculate the MAF classes and their frequencies based on the total number of snps present.
